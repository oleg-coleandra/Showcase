    "body": "Psycho delivered the shocks, North By Northwest the thrills and Rebecca the Oscar, but if one film can lay claim to the title of The Master's masterpiece, it's Vertigo.\nA seamless combination of psychological mystery, twisted romance, surrealism and technical innovation, it's the perfect embodiment of the Hitchcock motto: to mesmerise, unnerve and discombobulate.\nIn what was to be his last Hitch-up (his age was cited for the film's lukewarm box office), Stewart plays former San Francisco detective John Ferguson, whose nickname 'Scottie' is never explained... unlike his early retirement, the result of a rooftop chase during which Scottie - paralysed by acrophobia - watched helplessly as a fellow officer fell to his death.\nWhile his best friend Midge (Bel Geddes) helps him overcome both his condition and his guilty conscience, Scottie is contacted by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), an old college buddy who wants him to follow his wife Madeleine (Novak).\nGavin is driven not by suspicion but concern. It seems that Madeleine is possessed by the spirit of an ancestor who committed suicide; visiting her grave, returning to her old home, and gazing for hours at her portrait in an art gallery.\nBut the observer is forced to turn saviour when Madeleine throws herself into San Francisco Bay. Beguiled and now completely besotted, he vows to solve the mystery and end her psychological torment forever.\nHis endeavours meet with tragic success.\nMonths later, Scottie is a haunted man. But a chance encounter on the street suggests that history is about to repeat itself...\nHaving written the source novel for the twisty French classic Les Diaboliques, authors Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac allegedly had Hitchcock in mind when they wrote the book D'entre les Morts (Back From The Dead) on which Vertigo is based. Deception and obsession are on the agenda once again.\nOften accused of treating actors like cattle, Hitchcock nevertheless brought out the best from his performers, particularly his leading ladies who were often cast for their (invariably blonde) looks over their acting ability.\nThe glacial Novak was never - and would never be - better than in her dual role here, while Barbara Bel Geddes may forever be remembered as Miss Ellie from Dallas, but her portrayal the loyal, loving Midge is a far worthier legacy.\nAnd while Stewart may have been a tad long in the tooth to convincingly sweep Novak off her feet, this is still one of his most layered performances, encompassing guilt, sadness, and an obsession that verges on the pitiable.\nIt's also impossible not to be seduced by Bernard Herrmann's marvellous score and the superb use of locations in and around San Francisco.\nOn top of all this, the film opened a cinematic box of tricks which are still used today, from Hitch's dizzying zoom in/pull back manoeuvre (capturing Scottie's acrophobia) to artist John Ferren's dream sequence, the influence of which can be seen in TV title sequences as diverse as Doctor Who and Mad Men.\nHitch freely admitted to plot developments that don't quite add up and leaving the odd loose end (think back to the hotel). He called them 'fridge moments', because if he'd done his job right, viewers would be so absorbed they would be safely home before they worked them out.\nBut make no mistake, Vertigo represents The Master at the height of his powers.",

    "body": "The investigation into Hirohito’s war crimes complicity is a detective story worthy of Dashiell Hammett.\nSecluded in his heavily guarded palace, the emperor is protected by the heavy cloak of Japanese reticence in deference to their “living God”, with numerous governmental flunkies (including Prime Minister Tojo) refusing to incriminate the figurehead.\nAll this is set against the backdrop of a country bombed into the Stone Age, with a shattered populace teetering on the brink of desperate anarchy. An anarchy that will erupt if the emperor is hung as a war criminal, but Washington is crying out for a conviction to appease voters baying for blood.\nThis component parts are present and correct in Emperor, but director Peter Webber cannot capture the momentousness of the period, falling back on the “slot A into tab B” dramatics in Vera Blasi and David Klass’ script.\nFox’s General Fellers is charged with uncovering the truth about Hirohito’s culpability and ticks all politically sensitive boxes. An expert in Japanese culture and psychology following a pre-war liaison with a Japanese love interest (Hatsune), for whom he searches in the post-war rubble, Fox’s expository role is heavy on dialogue labouring points about Japan’s warrior spirit, honour and rigid rules of conduct.\nGolden-hued flashbacks to the lost love dissipate what little tension Webber can muster and there is little variation on the tight-lipped officials scenes that unfold one after the next until Fellers reaches someone willing to talk.\nTommy Lee Jones has more fun as the larger-than-life MacArthur, a man full of bravado and “American swagger” who shrewdly distances himself from the investigation lest it ruin his Presidential campaign hopes.\nTokyo’s devastated landscape is effectively rendered and flashbacks to the militaristic government’s response to Hirohito’s decision to surrender suggest a far more interesting story waits to be told.\nUndemanding, handsome and played with conviction, but sorely missing any sense of urgency.",

    "body": "Back in 1999,writer-director Malcolm D Lee hit box office gold with The Best Man, a cliche-free depiction of aspirational, middle class black Americans whose inspiration was less Shaft and more graft.\nWhen we left them Morris Chestnut's New York Giants running back Lance had just married Mia (Calhoun) despite her admitting an affair with Lance's best bud Harper (Diggs).\nFast-forward a decade and a half and there's still bad blood between Lance and Harper and the latter's career as a writer is on the wane and he's been fired from his university teaching job.\nHowever, he hits on the the sneaky idea of accepting an invite to a Christmas house party from Lance and Mia at their tacky mansion so that he can gather material for a warts'n'all unauthorised biography of the unsuspecting Giants star.\nDespite Lee's occasional tendency to soggy melodrama, his original film was a wry, entertaining take on a demographic previously overlooked -the black middle class - and spawned a whole flurry of similarly-themed fare, from the trite romance of Baggage Claim to the sharp, mating-game-turns-to-war comedy Think Like A Man.\nThis rom-com-dram take on The Big Chill isn't quite up there with Lee's debut but it never succumbs to the grim sudsiness waded through in Tyler Perry territory.\nWhere it does succeed is in the quality of the acting, particularly Terrence Howard's slightly ridiculous player Quentin, a nicely-played comedy distraction when the romantic drama is getting a tad too mawkish.\nLarger-than-life performances in a movie that deals in broad brush strokes also include Melissa De Sousa's Shelby, a upholstered bombshell and successful businesswoman who bitchily resents the former stripper who snared \"her man\".\nBut it's the fractured bromance between Chestnut and Diggs, a richly-worked love-hate relationship that provides the movie's real emotional ballast, an authentic test for a God-fearing alpha male to forgive his oldest friend.",

    "body": "Eugene Allen joined the backroom staff of the White House in 1952 as a lowly pantry man. By his retirement in 1986, he was the head butler, having served under eight US presidents, admired and respected by politicians and staff alike.\nIt’s Allen’s story which loosely inspires The Butler, his name - and backstory - changed for dramatic embellishment. Forest Whitaker plays the softly spoken servant - here renamed Cecil Gaines - who swiftly rises through the White House ranks; Britain’s David Oyelowo plays his rebellious activist son Louis.\nThrough Louis, we are given a potted history of America’s fledgling civil rights movement: from its humble beginnings in nonviolent diner sit-ins, through to the radical militantism of the Black Panthers.\nDaniels’ depiction of this era is well-balanced, gripping, and often electrifying. Occasional snippets of real-life media solidify the significance of the movement.\nCecil’s unique vantage point - a front row seat behind-the-scenes of a superpower - is certainly fascinating, and the typically American fondness for mythologising presidents allows for some fun cameos, including Robin Williams, Alan Rickman, and John Cusack (the latter sporting a daft prosthetic snout).\nAs Precious proved, Lee Daniels is an actor’s director, and there are stunning turns from the whole cast - particularly from Oyelowo and Oprah Winfrey (devastatingly brilliant as Cecil’s alcoholic wife).",

I'm interested in your behaviour. Get out of here and behave yourself.\"\nIn an obvious effort to keep Libby from being too cold-blooded, her main motive to find her husband is not to settle the score, but merely to see her son again.\nThe presence of Judd in the lead does go a long way in keeping the film entertaining.",

    "body": "From the makers of last year's Justin Bieber: Never Say Never comes this new pop tour doc about California Gurl Katy Perry, following the pop sensation as she embarks on a massive world tour.\nIt's a neatly packaged, good-looking affair which intersperses prep and performances from the tour itself with talking heads, past footage and, of course, interviews with the ever effervescent Perry herself.\n\"Everyone thinks she's a puppet, that her success came out of nowhere, but that's not the case at all,\" coos her loyal sister, who is also part of an entourage that genuinely all seem to get along.\nCue flashbacks of Perry's past, including the well-known - her Pentecostal background and her supportive but slightly scandalised minister parents, and the less well-known -  she moved to L. A. in her teens.\nThere, she was dropped by not one, not two but three record labels before finally finding success and going on to become the first woman ever to achieve five number one singles from one album and only the second person in he world to do so after Michael Jackson.\nWhatever you think of Perry's brand of bubblegum pop and cartoon costumes, this is not a success story even the hardest of hearts can begrudge.\nPerry's innate likeability and charisma is the first of two things that make this documentary more watchable than it might otherwise be. The other is the ghost of Russell Brand.\nSometimes documentary makers just luck out, and in this case they have, at the very painful expense of the film's subject. The tour - and the cameramen - began within months of Perry's lavish wedding to the British comedian. By the time the tour and film are up, divorce is on its way.\nBrand only pops up on a couple of occasions, and looks like a rabbit in headlights when he does (the comedian reportedly asked for footage with him in it to be edited out), but the lack of him casts a shadow.\nIt's clear whose side the film is on, as Perry flies back and forth to meet Brand wherever he is, before she finally succumbs to tears of exhaustion and heartbreak.\nThe one truly poignant moment of the whole film comes when Perry dons a robotic smile as she is ferried on to the stage, moments after a bout of hysterical crying. Would the film have worked without this perspective? Perhaps not.",

Neither does having two Secret Service goons posted outside your door 24/7.\nHope comes in the rippling form of beefcake Marc Blucas, the resident advisor (no idea what that is) in her college dorm.",

But if you're looking for a mindless scare-fest, this sequel is not a bad choice.\nThe film picks up where the original Friday the 13th left off, and is set five years after the infamous bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, where Jason Voorhees and his psychotic mother murdered seven camp counsellors.\nNow, a nearby campsite has been turned into a counsellor training centre, and Jason is on the hunt for more flesh. What follows is the basic slasher routine.\nThe Friday the 13th movies were never made to be taken too seriously. The fun of these movies is quite simply the gore, the carnage and the brutality.",
